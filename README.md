# 🤖 AI-Powered Intent Classification Chatbot (BERT + FastAPI)

An end-to-end **NLP-based conversational intent classification system** built using **PyTorch, Transformers (BERT), and FastAPI**.  
The system classifies user queries into predefined intents with **confidence scoring and fallback handling**, making it suitable for **real-world customer support and chatbot applications**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern chatbots and customer support systems must understand **user intent accurately** before responding.  
This project demonstrates how to build a **production-grade intent classification backend** using:

- Large real-world conversational dataset (**Banking77**)
- Deep Learning & Transformers (**BERT**)
- REST API deployment using **FastAPI**

The system is scalable and can be extended to:
- Customer Support Ticket Intelligence
- AI Chatbots
- Resume Screening Systems
- Document Q&A Routers
